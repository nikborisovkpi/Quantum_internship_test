# Quantum_internship_test
The goal of this test is to evaluate my skills and knowledge in such Data Science fields as
Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I need to to solve 2 tasks linked with
these Data Science domains.

### Task 1. Natural Language Processing. Named entity recognition
In this task, we need to train a named entity recognition (NER) model for the identification of
mountain names inside the texts. For this purpose you need:
- Find / create a dataset with labeled mountains.
- Select the relevant architecture of the model for NER solving.
- Train / finetune the model.
- Prepare demo code / notebook of the inference results.

The output for this task should contain:
- Jupyter notebook that explains the process of the dataset creation.
- Dataset including all artifacts it consists of.
- Link to model weights.
- Python script (.py) for model training.
- Python script (.py) for model inference.
- Jupyter notebook with demo.

Recommendation:
- Look into possibilities of ChatGPT for dataset generation;
- Check BERT-based pre-trained models for NER problem;


### Task 2. Computer vision. Sentinel-2 image matching
In this task, you will work on the algorithm (or model) for matching satellite images. For the
dataset creation, you can download Sentinel-2 images from the official source or use our
dataset from Kaggle. Your algorithm should work with images from different seasons. For this
purpose you need:
- Prepare a dataset for keypoints detection and image matching (in case of using the ML approach).
- Build / train the algorithm.
- Prepare demo code / notebook of the inference results.

The output for this task should contain:
- Jupyter notebook that explains the process of the dataset creation.
- Link to the dataset (Google Drive, etc.).
- Link to model weights.
- Python script (.py) for model training or algorithm creation.
- Python script (.py) for model inference.
- Jupyter notebook with demo.

Recommendation:
- Check deep learning possibilities to solve this task. Classical solutions can be not
accurate enough for images from different seasons.
- Satellite images have large sizes. You should think about how to process them in
order not to lose the quality.
